# Tic-Tac-Toe
Its a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game. You play by clicking on white boxes. 
Player "O" Starts. 
You can reset the game by clicking the button under the game board that says "Reset Game".
After someone wins you will see big text that says who has won or if no one wan it shows a big text "DRAW!".
I have added comments to all of the code in JS. I hope that those comments make it easy to understand the code.  
HTML code is not sementic. I wanted to focus more on JS and the game, instead of HTML and how it looks.
